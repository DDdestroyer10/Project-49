        <p><i>Interesting facts about cicadas</i></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. They are about the size of a grain of rice when they drop from a tree branch to the ground and start digging.</li>
            <li>Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes.</li>
            <li>They’re true bugs (from the order Hemiptera). So you can call them a bug and be scientifically accurate.</li>
